- Create an out of source build directory, say build-fgms, and in that 
  directory run 'cmake [OPTIONS] /path/to/fgms/source'.
  Read the source CMakeLists.txt for available options.

- run "make"

- run "make install"

- copy the file "contrib/etc/fgms_production.skel.conf" to "fgms.conf", edit this file to your
  needs and copy it to your "sysconfdir"

- run "fgms --help" for command line help

- run "fgms"

See README.cmake for further information on building, etc...
