                show the log
        [MISC]  deleted src/simgear/debug/*

        [NEW]   show client protocol version in CLI
        [FIX]   fgms only checks major version of client protocol
                it's strongly suggested to increase the minor version if
                the protocol has changed at all, increase the major version
                if the new version is incompatible to previous versions
        [NEW]   added a whitelist, configurable via config file and cli
                That way a client can whitelist its uplink, whithout the
                need to configure the uplink as a valid relay.
        [NEW]   Ping Packets
                fgms responds to PING packets (MsgID 9)
                Packet is sent verbatim back to sender, only the MsgID is
                set to PONG (ID 10).
                It's up to fgfs to make something out of it.
